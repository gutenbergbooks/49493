<p class='dramaline'>Eurotas singing slips from pool to pool;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Down rocky gullies; through the cavernous pines</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And chestnut groves; down where the terraced vines</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And gardens overhang; through valleys grey</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With olive trees, into a soundless bay</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of the Ægean. Silent and asleep</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Lie those pools now: but where they dream most deep,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Men sometimes see ripples of shining hair</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And the young grace of bodies pale and bare,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Shimmering far down—the ghosts these mirrors hold</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of all the beauty they beheld of old,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>White limbs and heavenly eyes and the hair’s river of gold,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For once these banks were peopled: Spartan girls</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Loosed here their maiden girdles and their curls,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And stooping o’er the level water stole</p>
<p class='dramaline'>His darling mirror from the sun through whole</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Rapturous hours of gazing.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>
<span class='verse-align-noindent'>Rapturous hours of gazing.</span>The first star</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of all this milky constellation, far</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Lovelier than any nymph of wood or green,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Was she whom Tyndarus had made his queen</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For her sheer beauty and subtly moving grace—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Leda, the fairest of our mortal race.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Hymen had lit his torches but one week</p>
<p class='dramaline'>About her bed (and still o’er her young cheek</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Passed rosy shadows of those thoughts that sped</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Across her mind, still virgin, still unwed,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For all her body was her own no more),</p>
<p class='dramaline'>When Leda with her maidens to the shore</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of bright Eurotas came, to escape the heat</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of summer noon in waters coolly sweet.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>By a brown pool which opened smooth and clear</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Below the wrinkled water of a weir</p>
<p class='dramaline'>They sat them down under an old fir-tree</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To rest: and to the laughing melody</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of their sweet speech the river’s rippling bore</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A liquid burden, while the sun did pour</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Pure colour out of heaven upon the earth.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The meadows seethed with the incessant mirth</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of grasshoppers, seen only when they flew</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Their curves of scarlet or sudden dazzling blue.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Within the fir-tree’s round of unpierced shade</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The maidens sat with laughter and talk, or played,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Gravely intent, their game of knuckle-bones;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Or tossed from hand to hand the old dry cones</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Littered about the tree. And one did sing</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A ballad of some far-off Spartan king,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Who took a wife, but left her, well-away!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Slain by his foes upon their wedding-day.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>“That was a piteous story,” Leda sighed,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>“To be a widow ere she was a bride.”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>“Better,” said one, “to live a virgin life</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Alone, and never know the name of wife</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And bear the ugly burden of a child</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And have great pain by it. Let me live wild,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A bird untamed by man!” “Nay,” cried another,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>“I would be wife, if I should not be mother.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Cypris I honour; let the vulgar pay</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Their gross vows to Lucina when they pray.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Our finer spirits would be blunted quite</p>
<p class='dramaline'>By bestial teeming; but Love’s rare delight</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Wings the rapt soul towards Olympus’ height.”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>“Delight?” cried Leda. “Love to me has brought</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Nothing but pain and a world of shameful thought.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>When they say love is sweet, the poets lie;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>’Tis but a trick to catch poor maidens by.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>What are their boasted pleasures? I am queen</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To the most royal king the world has seen;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Therefore I should, if any woman might,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Know at its full that exquisite delight.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Yet these few days since I was made a wife</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Have held more bitterness than all my life,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>While I was yet a child.” The great bright tears</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Slipped through her lashes. “Oh, my childish years!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Years that were all my own, too sadly few,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>When I was happy—and yet never knew</p>
<p class='dramaline'>How happy till to-day!” Her maidens came</p>
<p class='dramaline'>About her as she wept, whispering her name,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Leda, sweet Leda, with a hundred dear</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Caressing words to soothe her heavy cheer.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>At last she started up with a fierce pride</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Upon her face. “I am a queen,” she cried,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>“But had forgotten it a while; and you,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Wenches of mine, you were forgetful too.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Undress me. We would bathe ourself.” So proud</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A queen she stood, that all her maidens bowed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In trembling fear and scarcely dared approach</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To do her bidding. But at last the brooch</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Pinned at her shoulder is undone, the wide</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Girdle of silk beneath her breasts untied;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The tunic falls about her feet, and she</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Steps from the crocus folds of drapery,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Dazzlingly naked, into the warm sun.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>God-like she stood; then broke into a run,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Leaping and laughing in the light, as though</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Life through her veins coursed with so swift a flow</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of generous blood and fire that to remain</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Too long in statued queenliness were pain</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To that quick soul, avid of speed and joy.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>She ran, easily bounding, like a boy,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Narrow of haunch and slim and firm of breast.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Lovelier she seemed in motion than at rest,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>If that might be, when she was never less,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Moving or still, than perfect loveliness.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>At last, with cheeks afire and heaving flank,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>She checked her race, and on the river’s bank</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Stood looking down at her own echoed shape</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And at the fish that, aimlessly agape,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Hung midway up their heaven of flawless glass,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Like angels waiting for eternity to pass.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Leda drew breath and plunged; her gasping cry</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Splashed up; the water circled brokenly</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Out from that pearly shudder of dipped limbs;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The glittering pool laughed up its flowery brims,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And everything, save the poor fish, rejoiced:</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Their idiot contemplation of the Moist,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The Cold, the Watery, was in a trice</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Ended when Leda broke their crystal paradise.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Jove in his high Olympian chamber lay</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Hugely supine, striving to charm away</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In sleep the long, intolerable noon.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But heedless Morpheus still withheld his boon,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And Jove upon his silk-pavilioned bed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Tossed wrathful and awake. His fevered head</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Swarmed with a thousand fancies, which forecast</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Delights to be, or savoured pleasures past.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Closing his eyes, he saw his eagle swift,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Headlong as his own thunder, stoop and lift</p>
<p class='dramaline'>On pinions upward labouring the prize</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of beauty ravished for the envious skies.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He saw again that bright, adulterous pair,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Trapped by the limping husband unaware,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Fast in each other’s arms, and faster in the snare—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And laughed remembering. Sometimes his thought</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Went wandering over the earth and sought</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Familiar places—temples by the sea,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Cities and islands; here a sacred tree</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And there a cavern of shy nymphs.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>
<span class='verse-align-noindent'>And there a cavern of shy nymphs.</span>He rolled</p>
<p class='dramaline'>About his bed, in many a rich fold</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Crumpling his Babylonian coverlet,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And yawned and stretched. The smell of his own sweat</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Brought back to mind his Libyan desert-fane</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of mottled granite, with its endless train</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of pilgrim camels, reeking towards the sky</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Ammonian incense to his hornèd deity;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The while their masters worshipped, offering</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Huge teeth of ivory, while some would bring</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Their Ethiop wives—sleek wineskins of black silk,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Jellied and huge from drinking asses’ milk</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Through years of tropical idleness, to pray</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For offspring (whom he ever sent away</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With prayers unanswered, lest their ebon race</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Might breed and blacken the earth’s comely face).</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Noon pressed on him a hotter, heavier weight.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>O Love in Idleness! how celibate</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He felt! Libido like a nemesis</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Scourged him with itching memories of bliss.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The satin of imagined skin was sleek</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And supply warm against his lips and cheek,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And deep within soft hair’s dishevelled dusk</p>
<p class='dramaline'>His eyelids fluttered; like a flowery musk</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The scent of a young body seemed to float</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Faintly about him, close and yet remote—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For perfume and the essence of music dwell</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In other worlds among the asphodel</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of unembodied life. Then all had flown;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>His dream had melted. In his bed, alone,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Jove sweating lay and moaned, and longed in vain</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To still the pulses of his burning pain.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In sheer despair at last he leapt from bed,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Opened the window and thrust forth his head</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Into Olympian ether. One fierce frown</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Rifted the clouds, and he was looking down</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Into a gulf of azure calm; the rack</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Seethed round about, tempestuously black;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But the god’s eye could hold its angry thunders back.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>There lay the world, down through the chasméd blue,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Stretched out from edge to edge unto his view;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And in the midst, bright as a summer’s day</p>
<p class='dramaline'>At breathless noon, the Mediterranean lay;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And Ocean round the world’s dim fringes tossed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>His glaucous waves in mist and distance lost;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And Pontus and the livid Caspian Sea</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Stirred in their nightmare sleep uneasily.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And ’twixt the seas rolled the wide fertile land,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Dappled with green and tracts of tawny sand,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And rich, dark fallows and fields of flowers aglow</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And the white, changeless silences of snow;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>While here and there towns, like a living eye</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Unclosed on earth’s blind face, towards the sky</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Glanced their bright conscious beauty. Yet the sight</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of his fair earth gave him but small delight</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Now in his restlessness: its beauty could</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Do nought to quench the fever in his blood.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Desire lends sharpness to his searching eyes;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Over the world his focused passion flies</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Quicker than chasing sunlight on a day</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of storm and golden April. Far away</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He sees the tranquil rivers of the East,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Mirrors of many a strange barbaric feast,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Where un-Hellenic dancing-girls contort</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Their yellow limbs, and gibbering masks make sport</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Under the moons of many-coloured light</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That swing their lantern-fruitage in the night</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of overarching trees. To him it seems</p>
<p class='dramaline'>An alien world, peopled by insane dreams.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But these are nothing to the monstrous shapes—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Not men so much as bastardy of apes—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That meet his eyes in Africa. Between</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Leaves of grey fungoid pulp and poisonous green,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>White eyes from black and browless faces stare.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Dryads with star-flowers in their woolly hair</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Dance to the flaccid clapping of their own</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Black dangling dugs through forests overgrown,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Platted with writhing creepers. Horrified,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He sees them how they leap and dance, or glide,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Glimpse after black glimpse of a satin skin,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Among unthinkable flowers, to pause and grin</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Out through a trellis of suppurating lips,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of mottled tentacles barbed at the tips</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And bloated hands and wattles and red lobes</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of pendulous gristle and enormous probes</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of pink and slashed and tasselled flesh .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>
<span class='verse-align-noindent'>Of pink and slashed and tasselled flesh .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span>He turns</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Northward his sickened sight. The desert burns</p>
<p class='dramaline'>All life away. Here in the forkéd shade</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of twin-humped towering dromedaries laid,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A few gaunt folk are sleeping: fierce they seem</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Even in sleep, and restless as they dream.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He would be fearful of a desert bride</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As of a brown asp at his sleeping side,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Fearful of her white teeth and cunning arts.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Further, yet further, to the ultimate parts</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of the wide earth he looks, where Britons go</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Painted among their swamps, and through the snow</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Huge hairy snuffling beasts pursue their prey—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Fierce men, as hairy and as huge as they.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Bewildered furrows deepen the Thunderer’s scowl;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>This world so vast, so variously foul—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Who can have made its ugliness? In what</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Revolting fancy were the Forms begot</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of all these monsters? What strange deity—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>So barbarously not a Greek!—was he</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Who could mismake such beings in his own</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Distorted image. Nay, the Greeks alone</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Were men; in Greece alone were bodies fair,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Minds comely. In that all-but-island there,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Cleaving the blue sea with its promontories,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Lies the world’s hope, the seed of all the glories</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That are to be; there, too, must surely live</p>
<p class='dramaline'>She who alone can medicinably give</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Ease with her beauty to the Thunderer’s pain.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Downwards he bends his fiery eyes again,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Glaring on Hellas. Like a beam of light,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>His intent glances touch the mountain height</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With passing flame and probe the valleys deep,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Rift the dense forest and the age-old sleep</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of vaulted antres on whose pebbly floor</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Gallop the loud-hoofed Centaurs; and the roar</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of more than human shouting underground</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Pulses in living palpable waves of sound</p>
<p class='dramaline'>From wall to wall, until it rumbles out</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Into the air; and at that hollow shout</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That seems an utterance of the whole vast hill,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The shepherds cease their laughter and are still.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Cities asleep under the noonday sky</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Stir at the passage of his burning eye;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And in their huts the startled peasants blink</p>
<p class='dramaline'>At the swift flash that bursts through every chink</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of wattled walls, hearkening in fearful wonder</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Through lengthened seconds for the crash of thunder—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Which follows not: they are the more afraid.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Jove seeks amain. Many a country maid,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Whose sandalled feet pass down familiar ways</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Among the olives, but whose spirit strays</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Through lovelier lands of fancy, suddenly</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Starts broad awake out of her dream to see</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A light that is not of the sun, a light</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Darted by living eyes, consciously bright;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>She sees and feels it like a subtle flame</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Mantling her limbs with fear and maiden shame</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And strange desire. Longing and terrified,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>She hides her face, like a new-wedded bride</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Who feels rough hands that seize and hold her fast;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And swooning falls. The terrible light has passed;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>She wakes; the sun still shines, the olive trees</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Tremble to whispering silver in the breeze</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And all is as it was, save she alone</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In whose dazed eyes this deathless light has shone:</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For never, never from this day forth will she</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In earth’s poor passion find felicity,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Or love of mortal man. A god’s desire</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Has seared her soul; nought but the same strong fire</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Can kindle the dead ash to life again,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And all her years will be a lonely pain.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Many a thousand had he looked upon,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Thousands of mortals, young and old; but none—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Virgin, or young ephebus, or the flower</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of womanhood culled in its full-blown hour—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Could please the Thunderer’s sight or touch his mind;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The longed-for loveliness was yet to find.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Had beauty fled, and was there nothing fair</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Under the moon? The fury of despair</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Raged in the breast of heaven’s Almighty Lord;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He gnashed his foamy teeth and rolled and roared</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In bull-like agony. Then a great calm</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Descended on him: cool and healing balm</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Touched his immortal fury. He had spied</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Young Leda where she stood, poised on the river-side.</p>

<div class='dramastart'><!----></div>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Even as she broke the river’s smooth expanse,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Leda was conscious of that hungry glance,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And knew it for an eye of fearful power</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That did so hot and thunderously lour,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>She knew not whence, on her frail nakedness.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Jove’s heart held but one thought: he must possess</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That perfect form or die—possess or die.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Unheeded prayers and supplications fly,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Thick as a flock of birds, about his ears,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And smoke of incense rises; but he hears</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Nought but the soft falls of that melody</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Which is the speech of Leda; he can see</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Nought but that almost spiritual grace</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Which is her body, and that heavenly face</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Where gay, sweet thoughts shine through, and eyes are bright</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With purity and the soul’s inward light.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Have her he must: the teasel-fingered burr</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Sticks not so fast in a wild beast’s tangled fur</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As that insistent longing in the soul</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of mighty Jove. Gods, men, earth, heaven, the whole</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Vast universe was blotted from his thought</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And nought remained but Leda’s laughter, nought</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But Leda’s eyes. Magnified by his lust,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>She was the whole world now; have her he must, he must .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>His spirit worked; how should he gain his end</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With most deliciousness? What better friend,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>What counsellor more subtle could he find</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Than lovely Aphrodite, ever kind</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To hapless lovers, ever cunning, too,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In all the tortuous ways of love to do</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And plan the best? To Paphos then! His will</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And act were one; and straight, invisible,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He stood in Paphos, breathing the languid air</p>
<p class='dramaline'>By Aphrodite’s couch. O heavenly fair</p>
<p class='dramaline'>She was, and smooth and marvellously young!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>On Tyrian silk she lay, and purple hung</p>
<p class='dramaline'>About her bed in folds of fluted light</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And shadow, dark as wine. Two doves, more white</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Even than the white hand on the purple lying</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Like a pale flower wearily dropped, were flying</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With wings that made an odoriferous stir,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Dropping faint dews of bakkaris and myrrh,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Musk and the soul of sweet flowers cunningly</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Ravished from transient petals as they die.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Two stripling cupids on her either hand</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Stood near with winnowing plumes and gently fanned</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Her hot, love-fevered cheeks and eyelids burning.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Another, crouched at the bed’s foot, was turning</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A mass of scattered parchments—vows or plaints</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Or glad triumphant thanks which Venus’ saints,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Martyrs and heroes, on her altars strewed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With bitterest tears or gifts of gratitude.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>From the pile heaped at Aphrodite’s feet</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The boy would take a leaf, and in his sweet,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Clear voice would read what mortal tongues can tell</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In stammering verse of those ineffable</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Pleasures and pains of love, heaven and uttermost hell.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Jove hidden stood and heard him read these lines</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of votive thanks—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Cypris, this little silver lamp to thee</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I dedicate.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;It was my fellow-watcher, shared with me</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Those swift, short hours, when raised above my fate</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In Sphenura’s white arms I drank</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of immortality.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>“A pretty lamp, and I will have it placed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Beside the narrow bed of some too chaste</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Sister of virgin Artemis, to be</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A night-long witness of her cruelty.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Read me another, boy,” and Venus bent</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Her ear to listen to this short lament.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Cypris, Cypris, I am betrayed!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Under the same wide mantle laid</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I found them, faithless, shameless pair!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Making love with tangled hair.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>“Alas,” the goddess cried, “nor god, nor man,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Nor medicinable balm, nor magic can</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Cast out the demon jealousy, whose breath</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Withers the rose of life, save only time and death.”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Another sheet he took and read again.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Farewell to love, and hail the long, slow pain</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of memory that backward turns to joy.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;O I have danced enough and enough sung;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;My feet shall be still now and my voice mute;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Thine are these withered wreaths, this Lydian flute,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Cypris; I once was young.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And piêtous Aphrodite wept to think</p>
<p class='dramaline'>How fadingly upon death’s very brink</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Beauty and love take hands for one short kiss—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And then the wreaths are dust, the bright-eyed bliss</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Perished, and the flute still. “Read on, read on.”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But ere the page could start, a lightning shone</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Suddenly through the room, and they were ’ware</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of some great terrible presence looming there.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And it took shape—huge limbs, whose every line</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A symbol was of power and strength divine,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And it was Jove.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“Daughter, I come,” said he,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>“For counsel in a case that touches me</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Close, to the very life.” And he straightway</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Told her of all his restlessness that day</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And of his sight of Leda, and how great</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Was his desire. And so in close debate</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Sat the two gods, planning their rape; while she,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Who was to be their victim, joyously</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Laughed like a child in the sudden breathless chill</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And splashed and swam, forgetting every ill</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And every fear and all, save only this:</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That she was young, and it was perfect bliss</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To be alive where suns so goldenly shine,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And bees go drunk with fragrant honey-wine,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And the cicadas sing from morn till night,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And rivers run so cool and pure and bright .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Stretched all her length, arms under head, she lay</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In the deep grass, while the sun kissed away</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The drops that sleeked her skin. Slender and fine</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As those old images of the gods that shine</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With smooth-worn silver, polished through the years</p>
<p class='dramaline'>By the touching lips of countless worshippers,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Her body was; and the sun’s golden heat</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Clothed her in softest flame from head to feet</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And was her mantle, that she scarcely knew</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The conscious sense of nakedness. The blue,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Far hills and the faint fringes of the sky</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Shimmered and pulsed in the heat uneasily,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And hidden in the grass, cicadas shrill</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Dizzied the air with ceaseless noise, until</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A listener might wonder if they cried</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In his own head or in the world outside.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Sometimes she shut her eyelids, and wrapped round</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In a red darkness, with the muffled sound</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And throb of blood beating within her brain,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Savoured intensely to the verge of pain</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Her own young life, hoarded it up behind</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Her shuttered lids, until, too long confined,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>It burst them open and her prisoned soul</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Flew forth and took possession of the whole</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Exquisite world about her and was made</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A part of it. Meanwhile her maidens played,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Singing an ancient song of death and birth,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Seed-time and harvest, old as the grey earth,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And moving to their music in a dance</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As immemorial. A numbing trance</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Came gradually over her, as though</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Flake after downy-feathered flake of snow</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Had muffled all her senses, drifting deep</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And warm and quiet.</p>

<div class='dramastart'><!----></div>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>
<span class='verse-align-noindent'>And warm and quiet.</span>From this all-but sleep</p>
<p class='dramaline'>She started into life again; the sky</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Was full of a strange tumult suddenly—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Beating of mighty wings and shrill-voiced fear</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And the hoarse scream of rapine following near.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In the high windlessness above her flew,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Dazzlingly white on the untroubled blue,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A splendid swan, with outstretched neck and wing</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Spread fathom wide, and closely following</p>
<p class='dramaline'>An eagle, tawny and black. This god-like pair</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Circled and swooped through the calm of upper air,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The eagle striking and the white swan still</p>
<p class='dramaline'>’Scaping as though by happy miracle</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The imminent talons. For the twentieth time</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The furious hunter stooped, to miss and climb</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A mounting spiral into the height again.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He hung there poised, eyeing the grassy plain</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Far, far beneath, where the girls’ upturned faces</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Were like white flowers that bloom in open places</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Among the scarcely budded woods. And they</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Breathlessly watched and waited; long he lay,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Becalmed upon that tideless sea of light,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>While the great swan with slow and creaking flight</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Went slanting down towards safety, where the stream</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Shines through the trees below, with glance and gleam</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of blue aerial eyes that seem to give</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Sense to the sightless earth and make it live.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The ponderous wings beat on and no pursuit:</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Stiff as the painted kite that guards the fruit,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Afloat o’er orchards ripe, the eagle yet</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Hung as at anchor, seeming to forget</p>
<p class='dramaline'>His uncaught prey, his rage unsatisfied.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Still, quiet, dead .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then the quickest-eyed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Had lost him. Like a star unsphered, a stone</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Dropped from the vault of heaven, a javelin thrown,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He swooped upon his prey. Down, down he came,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And through his plumes with a noise of wind-blown flame</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Loud roared the air. From Leda’s lips a cry</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Broke, and she hid her face—she could not see him die,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Her lovely, hapless swan.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>
<span class='verse-align-noindent'>Her lovely, hapless swan.</span>Ah, had she heard,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Even as the eagle hurtled past, the word</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That treacherous pair exchanged. “Peace,” cried the swan;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>“Peace, daughter. All my strength will soon be gone,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Wasted in tedious flying, ere I come</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Where my desire hath set its only home.”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>“Go,” said the eagle, “I have played my part,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Roused pity for your plight in Leda’s heart</p>
<p class='dramaline'>(Pity the mother of voluptuousness).</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Go, father Jove; be happy; for success</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Attends this moment.”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>
<span class='verse-align-noindent'>Attends this moment.”</span>On the queen’s numbed sense</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Fell a glad shout that ended sick suspense,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Bidding her lift once more towards the light</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Her eyes, by pity closed against a sight</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of blood and death—her eyes, how happy now</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To see the swan still safe, while far below,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Brought by the force of his eluded stroke</p>
<p class='dramaline'>So near to earth that with his wings he woke</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A gust whose sudden silvery motion stirred</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The meadow grass, struggled the sombre bird</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of rage and rapine. Loud his scream and hoarse</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With baffled fury as he urged his course</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Upwards again on threshing pinions wide.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But the fair swan, not daring to abide</p>
<p class='dramaline'>This last assault, dropped with the speed of fear</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Towards the river. Like a winged spear,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Outstretching his long neck, rigid and straight,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Aimed at where Leda on the bank did wait</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With open arms and kind, uplifted eyes</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And voice of tender pity, down he flies.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Nearer, nearer, terribly swift, he sped</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Directly at the queen; then widely spread</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Resisting wings, and breaking his descent</p>
<p class='dramaline'>’Gainst his own wind, all speed and fury spent,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The great swan fluttered slowly down to rest</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And sweet security on Leda’s breast.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Menacingly the eagle wheeled above her;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But Leda, like a noble-hearted lover</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Keeping his child-beloved from tyrannous harm,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Stood o’er the swan and, with one slender arm</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Imperiously lifted, waved away</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The savage foe, still hungry for his prey.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Baffled at last, he mounted out of sight</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And the sky was void—save for a single white</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Swan’s feather moulted from a harassed wing</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That down, down, with a rhythmic balancing</p>
<p class='dramaline'>From side to side dropped sleeping on the air.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Down, slowly down over that dazzling pair,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Whose different grace in union was a birth</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of unimagined beauty on the earth:</p>
<p class='dramaline'>So lovely that the maidens standing round</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Dared scarcely look. Couched on the flowery ground</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Young Leda lay, and to her side did press</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The swan’s proud-arching opulent loveliness,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Stroking the snow-soft plumage of his breast</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With fingers slowly drawn, themselves caressed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>By the warm softness where they lingered, loth</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To break away. Sometimes against their growth</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Ruffling the feathers inlaid like little scales</p>
<p class='dramaline'>On his sleek neck, the pointed finger-nails</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Rasped on the warm, dry, puckered skin beneath;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And feeling it she shuddered, and her teeth</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Grated on edge; for there was something strange</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And snake-like in the touch. He, in exchange,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Gave back to her, stretching his eager neck,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For every kiss a little amorous peck;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Rubbing his silver head on her gold tresses,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And with the nip of horny dry caresses</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Leaving upon her young white breast and cheek</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And arms the red print of his playful beak.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Closer he nestled, mingling with the slim</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Austerity of virginal flank and limb</p>
<p class='dramaline'>His curved and florid beauty, till she felt</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That downy warmth strike through her flesh and melt</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The bones and marrow of her strength away.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>One lifted arm bent o’er her brow, she lay</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With limbs relaxed, scarce breathing, deathly still;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Save when a quick, involuntary thrill</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Shook her sometimes with passing shudderings,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As though some hand had plucked the aching strings</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of life itself, tense with expectancy.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And over her the swan shook slowly free</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The folded glory of his wings, and made</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A white-walled tent of soft and luminous shade</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To be her veil and keep her from the shame</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of naked light and the sun’s noonday flame.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Hushed lay the earth and the wide, careless sky.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Then one sharp sound, that might have been a cry</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of utmost pleasure or of utmost pain,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Broke sobbing forth, and all was still again.</p>

we found Helen and that lamentable Cressid who was to Chaucer
the feminine paradox, untenably fantastic but so devastatingly actual,
the crystal ideal—flawed; and to Shakespeare the inevitable trull,
flayed to show her physiological machinery and the logical conclusion
of every the most heartrendingly ingenuous gesture of maidenhood.
(But, bless you! our gorge doesn’t rise. We are cynically well up
in the damning Theory of woman, which makes it all the more amusing
to watch ourselves in the ecstatic practice of her. Unforeseen
perversity.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fabulous Helen! At her firm breasts they used to mould delicate
drinking cups which made the sourest vinegar richly poisonous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The geometry of her body had utterly outwitted Euclid, and the
Philosophers were baffled by curves of a subtlety infinitely more elusive
and Eleusinian than the most oracular speculations of Parmenides.
They did their best to make a coherent system out of the incompatible,
but empirically established, facts of her. Time, for instance, was
abolished within the circle of her arms. “It is eternity when her lips
touch me,” Paris had remarked. And yet this same Paris was manifestly
and notoriously falling into a decline, had lost whatever sense
or beauty he once possessed, together with his memory and all skill
in the nine arts which are memory’s daughters. How was it then,
these perplexed philosophers wondered, that she could at one and the
same moment give eternity like a goddess, while she was vampiring
away with that divine thirsty mouth of hers the last dregs of a poor
mortal life? They sought an insufficient refuge in Heraclitus’ theory
of opposites.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Troilus was always to be found at sunset, pacing up
and down the walls by the western gate—quite mad. At dusk the
Greek camp-fires would blossom along Xanthus banks—one after
another, a myriad lights dancing in the dark.</p>

cœnobites, darkness and size render London inappreciable, Paris is
full of sparrows, the snow lies gritty on Berlin, Moscow has no verisimilitude,

this city of Troy is most of all real and fabulous with its charnel
beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is not Helen the end of our search—paradisal little World, symbol
and epitome of the Great? Dawn sleeps in the transparent shadow
of roses within her ear. The stainless candour of infinity—far-off
peaks in summer and the Milky Way—has taken marvellous form in
her. The Little World has its meteors, too, comets and shadowy
clouds of hair, stars at whose glance men go planet-struck. Meteors—yes,
and history it has. The past is still alive in the fragrance of her
hair, and her young body breathes forth memories as old as the
beginning of life—Eros first of gods. In her is the goal. I rest here

which seem for ever wet. There are no crevices for moss and toadflax,

“Glorious unnature. We have triumphed.”</p>

live among the perpetual degenerations of apotheoses. Sunset
dissolves into soft grey snow and the deep ocean of midnight, boundless
as forgetfulness or some yet undiscovered Pacific, contracts into the
green puddle of the dawn. The flowers burn to dust with their own
brightness. On the banks of ancient rivers stand the pitiful stumps
of huge towers and the ghosts of dead men straining to return into
life. The woods are full of the smell of transience. Beauty, then,
is that moment of descent when apotheosis tilts its wings downwards
into the gulf. The ends of the curve lose themselves parabolically
somewhere in infinity. Our sentimental eyes see only the middle
section of this degeneration, knowing neither the upper nor the
lower extremes, which some have thought to meet, godhead and
annihilation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Curiosity Shops! If I have said “Mortality is beauty,” it
was a weakness. The sense of time is a symptom of anæmia of the soul,
through which flows angelic ichor. We must escape from the dust
of the shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloistered darkness and sleep offer us their lotuses. Not to perceive
where all is ugly, eaten into by the syphilis of time, heart-sickening—this
is beauty; not to desire where death is the only consummation—wisdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Night is a measureless deep silence: daybreak brings back the
fœtid gutters of the town. O supreme beauty of a night that knows
no limitations—stars or the jagged edges of cock-crowing. Desperate,
my mind has desired it: never my blood, whose pulse is a rhythm of
the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the other extreme, Beatrice lacks solidity, is as unresponsive to
your kisses as mathematics. She too is an oubliette, not a way of life;
an oubliette that, admittedly, shoots you upwards into light, not
down to death; but it comes to the same thing in the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What, then, is the common measure? To take the world as it is,
but metaphorically, informing the chaos of nature with a soul, qualifying
transience with eternity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When flowers are thoughts, and lonely poplars fountains of aspiring
longing; when our actions are the poem of which all geographies
and architectures and every science and all the unclassed individual
odds and ends are the words, when even Helen’s white voluptuousness
matches some candour of the soul—then it will have been found, the
permanent and living loveliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not a far-fetched, dear-bought gem; no pomander to be
smelt only when the crowd becomes too stinkingly insistent; it is not
a birth of rare oboes or violins, not visible only from ten to six by
state permission at a nominal charge, not a thing richly apart, but an
ethic, a way of belief and of practice, of faith and works, mediæval
in its implication with the very threads of life. I desire no Paphian
cloister of pink monks. Rather a rosy Brotherhood of Common
Life, eating, drinking; marrying and giving in marriage; taking and
taken in adultery; reading, thinking, and when thinking fails, feeling
immeasurably more subtly, sometimes perhaps creating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arduous search for one who is chained by his desires to dead carcases,
whose eyes are dimmed with tears by the slow heart-breaking
twilights full of old family ghosts laid in lavender, whose despair cries
out for opiate and anodyne, craving gross sleep or a place on the airy
unsupported pinnacles which hang in the sterile upper chambers of
ether.</p>

1918. “If I should perish,” he wrote to me only five weeks before
his death, “if I should perish—and one isn’t exactly a ’good life’
at the moment—I wish you’d write something about me. It isn’t
vanity (for I know you’ll do me, if anything, rather less than justice!),
not vanity, I repeat; but that queer irrational desire one has for immortality
of any kind, however short and precarious—for frankly,
my dear, I doubt whether your verses will be so very much more
perennial than brass. Still, they’ll be something. One can’t, of
course, believe in any <span class='it'>au-delà</span> for one’s personal self; one would have
first to believe in some kind of a friendly god. And as for being a
spiritualist spook, one of those wretched beings who seem to spend
their eternity in trying to communicate with the earth by a single
telephone, where the number is always engaged, and the line chronically
out of order—well, all I can say is, Heaven preserve me from
such a future life. No, my only hope is you—and a damned poor
guarantee for eternity. Don’t make of me a khaki image, I beg. I’d
rather you simply said of me, as Erasmus did of his brother, ‘Strenuus
compotor, nec scortator ignavus.’ I sincerely hope, of course, that
you won’t have to write the thing at all—hope not, but have very
little doubt you will. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following poem is a tentative and provisional attempt to
comply with his request. Ridley was an adolescent, and suffered from
that instability of mind “produced by the mental conflict forced
upon man by his sensitiveness to herd suggestion on the one hand and to
experience on the other” (I quote from Mr. Trotter’s memorable work
on Herd Instinct), that characteristic instability which makes adolescence
so feebly sceptical, so inefficient, so profoundly unhappy. I
have fished up a single day from Ridley’s forgotten existence. It has
a bedraggled air in the sunlight, this poor wisp of Lethean weed.
Fortunately, however, it will soon be allowed to drop back into the
water, where we shall all, in due course, join it. “The greater part
must be content to be as though they had not been.”</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Here we are, here we are, here we are again!</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>The life so short, so vast love’s science and art,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>So many conditions of felicity.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;“Darling, will you become a part</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;Of my poor physiology?</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;And, my beloved, may I have</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;The latchkey of your history?</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;And while this corpse is what it is</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;Dear, we must share geographies.”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>So many conditions of felicity.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And now time was a widening gulf and space,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A fixed between, and fate still kept them apart.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Her voice quite gone; distance had blurred her face.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The life so short, so vast love’s science and art.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>So many conditions—and yet, once,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Four whole days,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Four short days of perishing time,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>They had fulfilled them all.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But that was long ago, ah! long ago,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Like the last horse bus, or the Christmas pantomime,</p>

<p class='dramaline'>With locks nobody knew the secret of,</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Was the loveliest face his eyes had ever seen,</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Then in a sudden fearful vision he saw</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Oh, how remote he walked along the street,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Jostling with other lumps of human meat!</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>He was so tired. The café doors invite.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Caverned within them, still lingers the night</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In shadowy coolness, soothing the seared sight.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He sat there smoking, soulless and wholly crass,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Sunk to the eyes in the warm sodden morass</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of his own guts, wearily, wearily</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Ruminating visions of mortality—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Memento Moris from the pink alcove,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Nightmare oppressiveness of profane love.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Cesspool within, and without him he could see</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Nothing but mounds of flesh and harlotry.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Like a half-pricked bubble pendulous in space,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The buttered leatheriness of a Jew’s face</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Looms through cigar-smoke; red and ghastly white,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Death’s-head women fascinate the sight.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>It was the nightmare of a corpse. Dead, dead .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Life’s evenness. London’s noise from afar</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Thought, a blind alley; action, which at best</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Too swift—and all the lives unknown,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Alone.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>A truce to summer and beauty and the pain</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of being too consciously alive among</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The things that pass and the things that remain,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>(Oh, equal sadness!) the pain of being young.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Truce, truce.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Once again he fled;—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>All his life, it seemed, was a flight;—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Fled and found</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Sanctuary in a cinema house.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Huge faces loomed and burst,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Like bubbles in a black wind.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He shut his eyes on them and in a little</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Slept; slept, while the pictures</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Passed and returned, passed once more and returned.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And he, like God in the midst of the wheeling world,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Slept on; and when he woke it was eight o’clock.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Jenny? Revenge is sweet; he will have kept</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;Dear Jenny waiting.</p>

<p class='dramaline'>The wind and sun caress them, dappling</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The deep green grass with shine and shadow;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And a little apart one slender sapling</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Sways in the wind and almost seems</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Conscious of its own supple grace,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And shakes its twin-hued leaves and gleams</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With silvery laughter, filling the place</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Where it stands with a sudden flash of human</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Beauty and grace; till from her tree</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Steps forth the dryad, now turned woman,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And sways to meet him. It is she.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Food and drink, food and drink:</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Olives as firm and sleek and green</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As the breasts of a sea god’s daughter,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Swimming far down where the corpses sink</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Through the dense shadowy water.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Silver and black on flank and back,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The glossy sardine mourns its head.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The red anchovy and the beetroot red,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With carrots, build a gorgeous stair—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Bronze, apoplexy and Venetian hair—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And the green pallor of the salad round</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Sharpens their clarion sound.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;De lady take hors d’œuvres? and de gentleman too?</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;Per due! Due! Echo answers: Du’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;“So, Jenny, you’ve found another Perfect Man.”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>“Perfect, perhaps; but not so sweet as you,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Not such a baby.” “Me? A baby. Why,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I am older than the rocks on which I sit.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;Oh, how delightful, talking about oneself!</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Golden wine, pale as a Tuscan primitive,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And wine’s strange taste, half loathsome, half delicious:</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Come, my Lesbia, let us love and live.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>What though the mind still think that one thing’s vicious</p>
<p class='dramaline'>More than another? If the thought can give</p>
<p class='dramaline'>This wine’s rich savour to our laughing kiss,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Let us preserve the Christian prejudice.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Oh, there are shynesses and silences,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Shynesses and silences!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But luckily God also gave us wine.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“Jenny, adorable—” (what draws the line</p>
<p class='dramaline'>At the mere word “love”?) “has anyone the right</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To look so lovely as you look to-night,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To have such eyes, such a helmet of bright hair?”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But candidly, he wondered, do I care?</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>He heard her voice and himself spoke,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But like faint light through a cloud of smoke,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>There came, unreal and far away,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Mere sounds utterly empty—like the drone</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of prayers, <span class='it'>crambe repetita</span>, prayers and praise,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Long, long ago, in the old School Chapel days;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Senseless, but so intrusive on one’s own</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Interior life one couldn’t even think .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>O sweet, rare, perilous, retchy drink!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Another glass .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='dramaline'>After the noise and the dizzy choking heat!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The bloodless lamps look down upon their own</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Green image in the polished roadway thrown,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And onward and out of sight the great road runs,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Smooth and dark as a river of calm bronze.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Freedom and widening space: his life expands,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Ready, it seems, to burst the iron bands</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of self, to fuse with other lives and be</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Not one but the world, no longer “I” but “She.”</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>See, like the dolorous memory</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of happy times in misery,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>An aged hansom fills the street</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With the superannuated beat</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of hollow hoofs and bells that chime</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Out of another quieter time.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“Good-night,” the last kiss, “and God bless you, my dear.”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>So, she was gone, she who had been so near,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>So breathing-warm—soft mouth and hands and hair—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A moment since. Had she been really there,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Close at his side, and had he kissed her? It seemed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Unlikely as something somebody else had dreamed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And talked about at breakfast, being a bore:</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Improbable, unsubstantial, dim, yet more</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Real than the rest of life; real as the blaze</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of a sudden-seen picture, as the lightning phrase</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With which the poet-gods strangely create</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Their brief bright world beyond the reach of fate.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Yet he could wonder now if he had kissed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Her or his own loved thoughts. Did she exist</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Now she was history and safely stowed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Down in the past? There (with a conscious smile),</p>
<p class='dramaline'>There let her rest eternal. And meanwhile,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Lamp-fringed towards meeting parallels, the road</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Stretched out and out, and the old weary horse,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Come from the past, went jogging his homeward course</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Uphill through time to some demoded place,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>On ghostly hoofs back to the safe Has-Been:—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But fact returns insistent as remorse;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Uphill towards Hampstead, back to the year of grace</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Nineteen hundred and seventeen.</p>
